# 40.651 Algorithmic Game Theory
This repo contains the files for a project for the above-mentioned course at Singapore University of Technology and Design, Spring 2019.

The group members are Tenzin Chan and Chen Hui.

## Description
The project aims to explore the dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks training. We have chosen to start with exploring the effects of using 2N output values for the discriminator, 2 neurons for each class, each specifying whether the output was real or fake for that class.

## Requirements
Install the requirements with `pipenv install`
